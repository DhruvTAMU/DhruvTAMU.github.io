<h1>About Us</h1>

<section class="sectionbodywrap">
<p>As Aggie engineers in SSFE, we strive to push innovation to new heights through the
development of our own aircraft in order to beat our previously set air speed records.</p>

<p>Our target
speed to surpass will be determined at the start of each design cycle, and the following two
semesters will be spent on aircraft development.</p>

<p>Amidst all of SSFE's successes and failures, we seek to foster a collaborative environment that demonstrates to our members what participating
in an engineering project is all about from both a technical and interpersonal perspective.</p>

<h2>Our Values</h2>
<p>Our values closely align with those given by the Aggie Honor Code, the Texas A&M University
Student Handbook, and legal regulations such as Title IX.

We expect our members to uphold a
high code of ethics and personal dignity that represents both SSFE and TAMU. Emphasis on
instilling honesty and integrity in our members will ensure the success of SSFE and its
constituentsâ€™ characters.

Extensive measures will be taken to ensure the safety and well-being of
all of its members and anyone we interact with external to the organization.

Other best practices
include the prevention of bodily, emotional, and reputational harm and maintaining the financial
stability of the organization.</p>
