<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>As Aggie engineers in SSFE, we strive to push innovation to new heights through the
development of our own aircraft in order to beat our previously set air speed records.</p>

<p>Our target
speed to surpass will be determined at the start of each design cycle, and the following two
semesters will be spent on aircraft development.</p>

<p>Amidst all of SSFEâ€™s successes and failures, we
seek to foster a collaborative environment that demonstrates to our members what participating
in an engineering project is all about from both a technical and interpersonal perspective.</p>
