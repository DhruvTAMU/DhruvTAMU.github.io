<h1>Our Process</h1>

<section class="sectionbodywrap">
<p>SSFE crafts their own set of goals/objectives, constraints, and requirements at the start of each project cycle. Following these guidelines, each of the engineering sub-teams, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Avionics/Propulsion, begin conducting research into their respective areas and drafting design concepts. The teams reconvene to discuss an integrative project architecture that offers the most preferences across the three teams while balancing the feasibility of implementation.</p>

<p>The concept phase then transitions into graphical design where CAD software helps convert our ideas into a more tangible form. The design phase also involves complementary simulation testing via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) softwares to name a couple. Once a primary design has been selected that satisfies the initial requirements and any additional needs of the sub-teams, SSFE schedules a design review with one or more Texas A&M professors. Feedback is then taken and incorporated into our original designs prior to the start of our manufacturing phase.</p>

<p>During manufacturing, students are trained in the operation of tools and machinery necessary for our specific aircraft’s fabrication processes. Careful methods that ensure minimal error and high precision are employed to yield a stable, performance-optimized aircraft. Simultaneous material/structural testing is conducted to validate that the simulation-anticipated environmental conditions that the aircraft will experience (i.e. peak loading) are sustained. Aircraft subsystems are tested separately for nominal performance and then again post-integration into the system. SSFE then consults Texas A&M faculty for a demonstration review before flight testing ensues.</p>

<p>Flight testing will give SSFE an opportunity to observe full operational performance and set a basis for the aircraft’s highest attainable speed. Through multiple flight tests and adjustments where necessary, the aircraft will be subject to a final test to attain a maximum speed record, which sets the precedent for the next project cycle. SSFE Engineers also undergo a post-processing analysis phase where a holistic view of the plane is taken to then discern which aircraft subsystems could be improved upon.</p>
